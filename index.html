        <h2>What are spells?</h2>
        <p>A spell is a controlled manifestation of magic that affects the world in a supernatural fashion. There are
            spells for conjuring objects out of thin air and vanishing objects into thin air, spells for transforming
            something into
            something else (transfiguration), spells for making object levitate or carry out certain actions (cahrms),
            as well as combative spells, like stunning and shielding.</p>

        <p>The action of performing a spell is referred to as <em>casting</em>> or <em>spellwork.</em>></p>

        <p>Generally cast by a witch or a wizard, spells were often produced with certain wand movements and a verbal
            incantation,
            or for more experienced witches and wizards, silently and wandlessly.</p>

        <p>Some spells could appear as jets of light. Because of this, spells could often miss, be dodged, or blocked,
            either with an object or another spell.</p>
